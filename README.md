# ImoBot DTTO â€“ CAD Design

This repository contains the **CAD models and design files** for the **ImoBot DTTO (Distributed Transformer Telescopic Omniwheel)** robot.  
DTTO is a modular and reconfigurable robotic platform that can adapt to different terrains and tasks by transforming its structure.

## ðŸ”§ My Contribution
I worked on the **3D CAD design** of the DTTO robot, focusing on:
- Creating accurate 3D models of the robot components
- Preparing assemblies for testing the reconfigurable mechanism
- Optimizing the design for 3D printing and manufacturing
